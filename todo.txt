TODO
	- finish the parsemode function
	- the recurse function needs to be looked at. Need to decide if it should return the return value of func.

	- Create function write_buffer that takes in a buffer and writes it out if it gets full. ******* (head needs it)
	- Could create functions that each write decimal octal hex and floats to
	  a buffer and writes the buffer out if it is full use these instead of sprintf. */

	- Use USAGEBEG and USAGEEND and make sure return values are correct.
	- Create a function that manages filling a buffer and writing it out to a fd
	  and returning an offset to where it left off.
	- Ensure all programs write out diagnostics.
	- Make IOVBEG and IOVEND better so they do not require {} to comply with c89. * Maybe *
	- Ensure all programs use XBD utility syntax guidelines or not.
	- Figure out a way to manage getopt properly.
